# 🐬 MySQL Practice Challenges


Hi there! 👋  
I'm currently studying at APTECH, and this repository contains a collection of MySQL challenges I’ve solved as part of my coursework and personal learning journey.

Whether you're a fellow APTECH student or just starting your MySQL adventure, I hope this helps you as much as it's helped me.
